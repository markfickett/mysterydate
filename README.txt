Mystery Date is a text-based game inspired by a board game with an electronic
talking phone:

This version uses MacOS's shell command `say` for text-to-speech, and to get
the dates' names (the names of MacOS's TTS voices). You can use it quietly by
editing game.py in any plain-text editor and changing "_QUIET = False" to
"_QUIET = True".
